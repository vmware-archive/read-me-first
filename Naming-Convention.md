# Naming Conventions

In order to ensure that our org is as organized as possible, we are asking anyone that creates a repo to please follow a number of a set of naming conventions. 


## Topics/Tags

The easiest, and least restrictive way to help organize your repositories is to add “Topics” or tag them with [GitHub’s Topic Feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-topics/) .  Topics work a lot like tags on other platforms. 

We ask that you tag your repo with the following information: 

- Team
- Product
- Coding Language(s)
- Subject Area


## Repo Names

Another way you are able to help organize your repositories, and consequently our org, is to include pieces of information in your repo title.

Ideal Repo Name: 

[team name]-[tool/project name], i.e. IPS-Panorama
