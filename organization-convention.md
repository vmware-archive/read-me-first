# Organizing Conventions

In order to ensure that our org is as organized as possible, we are asking anyone that creates a repo to indicate what product and team it belongs to in the form of tags, or "topics".


## Topics/Tags

The easiest, and least restrictive way to help organize your repositories is to add “Topics” or tag them with [GitHub’s Topic Feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-topics/) .  Topics work a lot like tags on other platforms. 

We ask that you tag your repo with the following information: 

- Team
- Product
- Coding Language(s)
- Subject Area


## Repo Names

While we don't want to enforce any type of naming convention, if you choose, another way you are able to help organize your repositories, and consequently our org, is to include pieces of information in your repo title.

An example of an ddeal repo name is: 

[team name]-[tool/project name], i.e. ips-panorama
