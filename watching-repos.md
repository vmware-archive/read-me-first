### Watching Repos in /pivotal

As part of the /pivotal org, you have view access to most repos. With this, you have the choice to watch any repos you’d like.  As it is a user level setting, by default only individual members can adjust the settings for which repos they “watch” - this is not controlled by the org owners. 

How to watch a repo
Note that admins do not have the ability to select repos for you
The following GitHub documentation provides steps for watching and unwatching either all of the repositories that you have push access to, or single repositories of your choosing:
https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories


__PLEASE NOTE__:

If you have selected to watch all repos to which you have push access to, any repo that gives write/push access to the All-Pivotal team could spam you with many notifications. Everyone is in All-Pivotal, so some of these repos could have hundreds of changes and you would be notified of all of them. 
If you would like to keep the setting to automatically watch any repo you are given push access to turned on, we recommend that you manually unwatch any repo that has a high volume of traffic with little importance to you (i.e. https://github.com/pivotal/onboarding).  This can be done through the UI by clicking “unwatch” in the upper right corner and selecting the level of visibility you would like to have.
